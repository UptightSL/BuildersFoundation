# Hello Reader!

Hello kind reader! This book contains all the information you need to live a comfortable life as a foundation researcher! (Out of Character Note: Only contains lore, hence why things that wouldn't be mentioned are mentioned! It is basically a player's guide.)

# Current World

The world of Builder's Foundation is centered around Minecraft, hence reality is not probable. 

## Lore Tips

Zephyr infected hosts are Husks. Now I don't know how long it'll take me to make this but getting hit by a husk means certain doom. Meaning you are to avoid them at all times. The only work around is having a Tesseractus on hand or having an armour capable of protecting against it.

# Facilities

There are over 340 Facilities constructed by the Foundation. A few are mentioned but the most important are explained here.

## Sword Base

Central hub for the Builders, A fallen base due to the infection 

Fun Facts:

* Sword Base is the only facility with a NAME instead of the F-DIGIT naming scheme.
* Sword Base is not mentioned in-game, it is frowned upond to talk about Sword Base especially to senior foundation workers.
* The Player is originally born at Sword Base during the fall, moving to F-001.

## F-001

F-001 Was the first facility ever built by the Builders. The facility was built by on-hand engineer's after the fall of Sword Base. F-001 was the first true facility to house dangerous anomalies, the anomalies being hostile meant err0r could not happen.

# Viral Anomalies

## Zephyr

Zephyr was the cause of death of thousands of foundation workers that had previously worked at Sword Base. The infection infects the hosts brain, taking over the brain and causing the worker to go into a frenzy.
